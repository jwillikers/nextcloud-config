Configuration for my {Nextcloud} server.

These are configuration files for my Nextcloud server, which is run via several containers.
See the https://github.com/jwillikers/home-lab-helm[home-lab-helm] repository for the containers' configuration.
Environment variables defined in that configuration cover most of the Nextcloud configuration. 
A couple of files are still required, so they are kept here.

== Usage

The files provided in the `etc` subdirectory are meant to be mounted inside the Nextcloud container under the `/usr/local` directory.
The subdirectory `docker-entrypoint-hooks.d/pre-installation` should be mounted under the root of the container, where it will be executed before installation.
The hook just concatenates the `/var/www/html/autoconfig.php` with the included `autoconfig.php` file.
This file includes configuration for things that are not configured automatically through environment variables in the container.
The home-lab-helm Kubernetes configuration expects this repository to be in a specific location.
Follow these instructions to put the files in the expected location.
