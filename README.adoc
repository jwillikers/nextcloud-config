= Nextcloud Config
:Nextcloud: https://nextcloud.com/[Nextcloud]

Configuration for my {Nextcloud} server.

These are configuration files for my Nextcloud server, which is run via several containers.
See the https://github.com/jwillikers/home-lab-helm[home-lab-helm] repository for the containers' configuration.
Environment variables defined in that configuration cover most of the Nextcloud configuration. 
A couple of files are still required, so they are kept here.
